<h1>How to Survive In Computer Science</h1>
<p><b>Here's What You Need To have To Survive Computer Science</b></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
<h3>Healthy Friendship</h3>
<center>
<p><b>Get yourself a reliable friends who you can reach out when you needed help when it comes to programming. Having a healthy friendship gives you a motivation unlike the others who will invite you to hang out than to finish your requirements, that’s the common reason why other students is suffering and having a cramming session, if there’s a five idiots and you joined them, you’re the 6th idiot. Bring yourself to those people who has passion to learn and graduate in time.</b></p>
<h3>Time Management</h3>
<p><b>A good student understands the value of education, but he or she also understands that time is of the essence. A student should, nevertheless, make time for personal development. Because personal development is essential for our good growth. A student's personality development is equally crucial. They should set out at least one hour for their interests such as gaming, painting, listening to music, and so on. It relieves the tension of the day since it is fun. </p></b>
<h3>Laptop</h3>
<p><b>This is optional if you have PC in your home but I highly recommend that you should have one because you’re not in your house always, so it is so convenient if you have laptop, you can do your work wherever you. The advantage of having laptop and it will help you a lot when you have laboratory activities, not all of you can access a pc because it is limited, what if you late and you run out of slot? If you have a laptop you can easily follow what your instructor teach because you can actually copy what he/she doing, so you’ll understand quickly.</p></b>
<h3>Patience </h3>
<p><b>Being patient allows one to gain better mental condition. It also helps you to become better mentally as a patient person is likely to have optimistic thoughts because here in Computer Science, your imagination is your limit when it comes to programming. I know this will be hard but guess what, all courses are hard also, just be patient, all problems are temporary, there’s saying that problem is just a first name and it’s last name is solution, so take heart. </p></b>
<h3>Rest</h3>
<p><b>Students should get the proper amount of sleep at night to help stay focused, improve concentration, and improve academic performance. Most people who do not get enough sleep have a higher risk for many health problems, so get some rest, sleep plenty enough, you did pass your requirements but you also passed away.</p></b>
